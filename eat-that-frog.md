## Core Idea

**“Eat the frog”** means doing your most important, hardest, highest-value task first—especially the one you’re most likely to procrastinate on.

Your productivity and success depend more on **prioritization and focus** than on how busy you are.

## The 21 Key Principles (Condensed)

### 1. Set Clear Goals
Write down clear, specific goals. Clarity removes hesitation and reduces procrastination.

---

### 2. Plan Every Day in Advance
Plan your day before it begins (ideally the night before).  
**10 minutes of planning can save up to 2 hours of execution.**

---

### 3. Apply the 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)
- 20% of tasks produce 80% of results  
- Focus on **high-impact tasks**, not easy or comfortable ones

---

### 4. Identify Your “Frog”
Ask yourself:
> *If I could do only one task today, which one would have the greatest positive impact?*

That task is your frog.

---

### 5. Practice Creative Procrastination
Since you can’t do everything, intentionally procrastinate on **low-value tasks**.

---

### 6. Use the ABCDE Method
- **A** – Must do (serious consequences)
- **B** – Should do (minor consequences)
- **C** – Nice to do (no consequences)
- **D** – Delegate
- **E** – Eliminate

Never work on B-tasks before completing all A-tasks.

---

### 7. Focus on Key Result Areas
Identify the areas you are responsible for and ensure consistent performance in each.

---

### 8. Apply the Law of Three
Three tasks usually account for most of your results.  
Identify and focus on those three.

---

### 9. Prepare Thoroughly Before You Start
Gather everything you need before starting. Preparation reduces friction and excuses.

---

### 10. Take One Step at a Time
Break large tasks into small, manageable actions.

---

### 11. Upgrade Your Key Skills
Procrastination often comes from fear or lack of competence.  
Improve the skills that matter most.

---

### 12. Leverage Your Special Talents
Spend more time on tasks that align with your strengths and create high value.

---

### 13. Identify Your Key Constraints
Ask:
> *What is the biggest bottleneck holding me back right now?*

Address it first.

---

### 14. Put Pressure on Yourself
Set personal deadlines instead of waiting for external pressure.

---

### 15. Maximize Personal Energy
Work on your most important tasks when your energy is highest—usually in the morning.

---

### 16. Motivate Yourself Into Action
Use positive self-talk and focus on solutions rather than problems.

---

### 17. Get Out of the Technology Trap
Limit distractions such as email, social media, and unnecessary notifications.

---

### 18. Slice and Dice the Task
Break tasks down until they are so small that starting feels effortless.

---

### 19. Create Large Time Blocks
Schedule uninterrupted blocks of deep work. Avoid multitasking.

---

### 20. Develop a Sense of Urgency
Act quickly on high-priority tasks. Speed builds momentum.

---

### 21. Single-Handle Every Task
Once you start a task, work on it until completion before moving on.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Procrastination is a **priority problem**, not a time problem
- One completed high-value task beats many half-finished ones
- Discipline and clarity outperform motivation

---

## One-Sentence Summary

> **Do the most important task first, without distraction, every day.**
